 *PURPOSE: Reads in a text file containing information about 
 *cities and their corresponding airport codes
 *Constructs a linkedlist of city objects containing 
 *this information
 *
 *The StackSearch.java class uses this class to compare airport codes for
 *available flights and requests and matches up the codes with the 
 *coresponding city.
